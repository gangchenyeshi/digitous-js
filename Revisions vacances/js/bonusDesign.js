## Designer bonus

    To fill the gaps in distance education, you are working on an application project that should allow you to display a virtual classroom in which learners can move through a drag and drop system. You are responsible for the design of the page and you use bootstrap.

    - Create a ** card template (** [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/ marge(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/)) to represent a learner.
    - In a container that will contain the entire page, create a default area where the learners' cards will be placed.
    - Create a "queue" area on which to move the cards to ask the trainer for help.
    - Create other areas that you wish you could move around throughout the day.
    - Let your imagination run wild to decorate the place and add features.
