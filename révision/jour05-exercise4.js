// - Install and import the `prompt` package (don't forget to initialize!) And run the` prompt` methods
// - Create a variable `mysteryNum` containing a random value (an integer between 1 and 100)
// - Create a `play` function that asks the player" What is the mystery number? " then:
// - if the player gives an incorrect value (not a number) we display "error" and restart the `play` function
// - if the player gives a number that is too small, we display "That's more!" and we restart the `play` function
// - if the player gives a number that is too large, we display "It's less!" and we restart the `play` function
// - if the player gives the right number, we display "Bravo !!"
// - Call the function
// - Test the game
